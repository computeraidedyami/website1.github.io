    <h2>React</h2>
    <p>JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UI)</p>
    <h2>Fundamentals</h2>
    <h3>Components</h3>
    <p>Isolated pieces of code to build user interfaces ,We use components to tell React what we want to see on the screen.
        When data changes, React will update an re-render our components.
        <br>
The <strong>render</strong> method returns a <em>description</em> of what you want to see on screen.In particular returns a <strong>React Element</strong>, which is a lightweight description of what to render.
    </p>
    <h5>React component class/type</h5>


    <h3>Props</h3>
    <p>usually on[event] is used for props whick represent events and handle[Event] names for the methods which handle the events</p>
    <h3>State</h3>



    <h3>Terms to learn</h3>

            </dd>
            <dt>Immutability</dt>
            <dd>unknown. Helps build pure components in React, it can easily determine if changes have been made which helps to determine when a component requires re-rendering</dd>
<dt>Functional Components</dt>
<dd>Simpler way to write components that only contain a <em>render</em> method and don't have their own state.</dd>
